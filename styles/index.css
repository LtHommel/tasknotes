/* 
   TaskNotes Plugin Styles - Source Index
   
   This file serves as documentation for the CSS build system.
   The actual styles.css file is generated by concatenating these files in order:
   
   1. variables.css - CSS custom properties and design system variables
   2. base.css - Basic styles, animations, card components, and layout
   3. task-card-bem.css - NEW BEM TaskCard component with proper scoping
   4. note-card-bem.css - NEW BEM NoteCard component with proper scoping
   5. filter-bar-bem.css - NEW BEM FilterBar component with proper scoping
   6. components.css - Reusable UI components, utilities, and modals
   7. calendar.css - Calendar view specific styles
   8. tasks.css - Task list and task item specific styles
   9. kanban.css - Kanban board view specific styles
   10. filters.css - Legacy filtering system styles (to be deprecated)
   
   To build the final styles.css file, run:
   npm run build-css
   
   During development, both 'npm run dev' and 'npm run build' will automatically
   build the CSS before running the main build process.

   === Development Workflow ===
   
   1. Edit the appropriate CSS file in the styles/ directory
   2. Run 'npm run build-css' to regenerate styles.css
   3. Test your changes in the application
   4. Commit both the source files and the generated styles.css
   
   The build process ensures that:
   - Variables are loaded first for use in all other files
   - Base styles are applied before component-specific styles
   - View-specific styles don't conflict with each other
   - The final CSS is properly ordered and documented
